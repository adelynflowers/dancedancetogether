# DanceDanceTogether

DanceDanceTogether helps make playing with two players in [Project Outfox](https://projectoutfox.com/) easier. It does three things:

1. Choose which controller should be player 1 and which should be player 2
2. Write those keymappings to the project outfox config file of your choice
3. Launch project outfox

Simply configure your outfox location and controller mappings, replace your project outfox shortcut with a shortcut to DanceDanceTogether instead, and enjoy correct mappings every time you play.

## Version 0.1 Checklist
- [ ] Identify joystick inputs on linux
- [ ] Prompt the user to choose between them for P1/P2
- [ ] Write corresponding hardcoded keymappings into a dummy config file in the project outfox format
